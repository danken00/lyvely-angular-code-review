# Lyvely code review

Part of keeping quality high in software develpoment is peer reviews. A keen eye for detail and understanding what your peers have written is key for keeping quality high.

As a senior and/or lead, we're expecting our successful candidate to pick up on all the small things, ensure we're following best industry standards, maintaining flexible and sustainable code. Other team members will be looking up to you to set the best examples, and to teach them the ways of good quality code.

### This test

Simply, a pull request. This is a very simple Angular project, with a single component, so the idea is to review this code and leave the updates like you normally would. We're not going to give hints on what you should and should not look for - this is to see how far you will go when reviewing someone else's code.



## Instructions

1. Fork this repository in GitHub
2. Create a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `release/v1.0.0` branch. This PR should include all the files because `release/v1.0.0` is an empty branch
3. Now you have a PR, go through and review it! Do it just like you're reviewing someone else's code
   1. Only review the `/src` directly as the rest is just standard Angular stuff
4. Once your PR is done, share your repository with `danken00` and let us know you've finished this task

Good luck!
